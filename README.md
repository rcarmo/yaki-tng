yaki-tng
========

A modern, revamped implementation of [Yaki][y].

# Status

Development is currently happening on a private Bitbucket repo and will be merged back here as time permits.

All in all this is working, but very shy of the target feature set. I'm having to put this on ice time and time again as other things impinge upon my time, but I manage to tinker a little now and then -- that stochastic approach is one of the reasons the `master` branch isn't very stable (I usually use `git-flow`, but in this case I'll only apply it here when I'm happy with the current refactoring).

Right now, I'm refactoring this to conform to [my usual pattern][pp] and make sure there's a cleaner separation of concerns (but there's still a little too much magic in the `yaki` library and a couple of the decorators).


## Main goals

* Move to a standard WSGI app model, using [Bottle][b] as both routing and templating engine - DONE
* Streamline the markup rendering pipeline - DONE
* Move all the cache management to an external process (Redis) - PARTIALLY DONE
* Split the indexer from the main body of code - DONE, CURRENTLY BROKEN
* Get it running at insanely high speeds inside `uWSGI+gevent` or `Gunicorn+gevent` (and PyPy) - TEST ONLY

## Secondary Goals

* Refactor all the configuration to use JSON - DONE
* Refactor all the inline logic according to MVC patterns - PARTIALLY DONE (missing some plugins)
* Provide a set of APIs for gathering data
* Increase resiliency (lower RAM footprint, better horizontal scaling, better fault tolerance, etc.)
* Python 3 support (eventually, I'm actually aiming for PyPy)

## Target Feature Set

* Support for (Multi)Markdown, Textile, raw HTML, etc. - DONE
* Flexible set of plugins - PARTIALLY DONE (some legacy plugins not ported over yet)
* Pygments integration (for technical documentation) - DONE
* Full-text indexing - PARTIALLY DONE (need to finish refactoring the indexing daemon)

## Batteries included

Yaki has always been designed around three simple rules:

* Pure Python
* No external dependencies - everything _ought_ to be included
* No databases

All of these are, of course, applied within reason.

Regrettably, due to the various licensing requirements and the need to push development forward, most third-party dependencies were removed from the repository.

Yaki now provides an explicit `requirements.txt` file that makes it easy to install everything else you need, and a `Vagrantfile` to easily reproduce the development environment anywhere.


# Dev Notes

Yaki now requires Redis (since it's the only sensible way to share state among worker processes and saves a _lot_ of time in metadata housekeeping).

## Using Vagrant

The `Vagrantfile` that ships with Yaki assumes an Ubuntu (precise64) target, but should work fine with most modern Debian-based distros. At the time of this writing, it works with Vagrant 1.4 and the `vagrant-lxc` plugin, and sets up the following for you:

* Redis
* `mkvirtualenv` and a supporting `virtualenv` containing:
  * Celery
  * uWSGI
  * Whoosh
  * All the other miscellaneous dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

If you decide to use `vagrant-lxc`, you can fetch a compatible box [from here](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Base-boxes#available-boxes).

## Coding

If you use the provided `Vagrantfile`, make sure you start your session with `workon yaki` to use the `virtualenv` it builds.

Before starting the development daemon, make sure you run:

    python tools/msgfmt.py lib/yaki/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/yaki.po
    
...to create the translation file(s).
